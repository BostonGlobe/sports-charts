			Individuals field goals are grouped together into bins based on proximity. The color is determined by comparing the bin’s overall field goal percentage of makes and misses to the league average of the zone the bin falls within (eg. “left corner three”). There 14 zones, including three in the paint, five for midrange field goals, and six for three point field goals. Above or below average means +/- 4% from league average. Bins with less than three shots are excluded from this graphic.
