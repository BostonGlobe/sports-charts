			Individual field goals are grouped into bins based on proximity. The color is determined by comparing the bin’s overall field goal percentage to the league average of the zone the bin falls within (eg. “left corner 3-pointer”). There 14 zones, including three in the paint, five for midrange field goals, and six for 3-point field goals. Above or below average means +/- 4% from league average. Bins with fewer than three shots are excluded.
